## Design

- What's the look and feel of it? Minimalist? Intricate? Goth?
	- Sleek, modern
- You'll do a lot more of this when we start thinking about CSS.
- Will you use images? Icons? From where? 
- Do some research! Look at other sites for inspiration.

## Code

You'll be using HTML and CSS, but as you think about your layout,
you might want to start thinking about logical sections of the page
(header, footer, sidebarâ€”if you want any of these things),
and how you might structure those with HTML.
